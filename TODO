Testing:
    ☐ Tests, tests, tests! (look into the possibility of snapshot tests to compare expected HTML output with the live output of test source files).

Miscelaneous:
    ☐ Class renders @description token itself when no token value is provided
    ☐ If no description is provided for a method, do not show blank space
    ☐ Do not show 'Parameters' sub-header when param token is provided with no value
